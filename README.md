## Running Tests ðŸ§ª

To execute all unit and widget tests, use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage 
```

To view the generated coverage report, you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
Mac or Linux:

# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

```sh
Windows:

# Generate Coverage Report
$ perl C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\lcov\tools\bin\genhtml -o coverage\html coverage\lcov.info

# Open Coverage Report
$ start coverage/html/index.html
```
